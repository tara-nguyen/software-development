# Fundamentals of Software Development

### Overview 

- Course offered at UCLA Extension
- **Instructor**: Keith Jefferies

### Description

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to computer programming and software development. It benefits individuals pursuing programming and software development as a career, as well as anyone in the IT field who works with programmers and systems analysts in important areas that precede actual programming, including problem-solving approaches; specifications and requirements; user interface design; and structured program design using such tools as hierarchy, Nassi-Schneiderman, and UML charts. Instruction covers programming concepts common to modern languages, including C, C#, Java, Visual Basic, and shell scripting. In addition to creating procedural programs (using C as the example language) and object-oriented programs (using Visual Basic), students produce small business applications in these two environments, plus a commercial-level application by the course's end. Instruction presents programming fundamentals, including variables and expressions; flow of control, including looping and selection; event-driven programming in the Windows .NET environment; file processing; and modular development. The course also covers the development cycle, including unit test and integration, alpha/beta testing, and software defect tracking and classification, plus examples of C#, Java, and SQL programming. This introductory course requires weekly programming assignments and prepares students for future coursework in C, C++, C#, Java, Visual Basic, or any other high-level language.
